	 * The primary method for solving incoming Raven's Progressive Matrices. For

	 * conclusion of Solve(), your Agent should return a String representing its
	 * answer to the question: "1", "2", "3", "4", "5", or "6". These Strings
	 * are also the Names of the individual RavensFigures, obtained through
	 * RavensFigure.getName().
	 * 
	 * In addition to returning your answer at the end of the method, your Agent
	 * may also call problem.checkAnswer(String givenAnswer). The parameter
	 * passed to checkAnswer should be your Agent's current guess for the
	 * problem; checkAnswer will return the correct answer to the problem. This
	 * allows your Agent to check its answer. Note, however, that after your
	 * agent has called checkAnswer, it will *not* be able to change its answer.
	 * checkAnswer is used to allow your Agent to learn from its incorrect
	 * answers; however, your Agent cannot change the answer to a question it
	 * has already answered.
	 * 
	 * If your Agent calls checkAnswer during execution of Solve, the answer it
	 * returns will be ignored; otherwise, the answer returned at the end of
	 * Solve will be taken as your Agent's answer to this problem.
	 *
